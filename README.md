# Cyber Augur
A website designed to manage the scope that a collection of security tools are allowed to scan. Items in the scopelist can be labelled so that custom scopes can be generated. 

## Problem Statement
Different bug bounty programs and scanners need limits to what they scan for legal and practical reasons. This project is intended to provide a website that can be used to configure this scope and also label items in scope. 

## Design Principles
- Use as few languages as possible
- One layer per container
- Integrate with scanning pipelines


## Quick Start

## Architecture

## Future Plans
Primary goals for this project are as follows:
- Create a simple web page that lists the scope
- Define data structure for each in scope item
- Create categorisation for each scope item
- Create tagging logic
- Create integration logic 

## Why the name?
An augur is an ancient Roman religious official that would interpet events and determine if they were good or bad omens. I think the word sounds cool.
